**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**


-Large quantities of surplus food generated by organizations, industries, hotels, and event venues are wasted daily, while many people in need struggle to access sufficient food. Existing food donation practices rely heavily on manual communication methods such as phone calls or messaging, which often lead to delays, poor coordination, food spoilage, and lack of transparency.
There is no centralized, secure, and real-time platform to connect food donors with NGOs and volunteers efficiently. This results in food wastage, limited traceability, and missed opportunities to support needy populations. Hence, there is a need for a reliable web-based system that ensures timely food distribution, food safety, and effective coordination.
The proposed system is a web-based surplus food donation management application that connects donors with NGOs and volunteers through a centralized platform. Organizations can post surplus food details along with location and expiry time, while NGOs can view, accept, and collect the food efficiently.
The system integrates Google Maps for location tracking, OTP-based verification for security, automated food expiry handling for safety, and a donation statistics dashboard for monitoring and analysis.
